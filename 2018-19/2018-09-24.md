### Apologies

### SUSU

Rota is now sorted out. We are going to have a couple of laptops.

Poster needs doing. There is an A1 printer in one of the computer rooms in Building 25. We do not have a poster design. Josh says that he is happy to do it.

### Faculty

George is available to man the stall. 

## Events

67/1037 is booked every Wednesday this semester for us from 6pm.

### Welcome Meeting

Proposed date is the 3rd of the October.

Expected numbers are between 100 and 200 attendees.

Welcome presentation at the start, and then some sort of practical activity. Web hacking is suggested, as is wireshark.

There is concern that if we make the activity too difficult, we will lose non-ECS people, yet lose ECS people if it is too easy.

We will release a more advanced challenge at the start, and then run through the session with less experienced people.

### The future

10th October: Bash 101: Here is a terminal. ls, cd, nano, mkdir, touch...
17th October: Network Reconnisance - nmap, etc.

## Merchandise

Mohammad ordered some, the supplier still has a template.

## Tech

Slide uploading thing will be made by George.

The VM is running out of storage, Josh will attempt to get more from iSolutions.

## Finance

Jamie still has the bank account. Josh is going to get it sorted.

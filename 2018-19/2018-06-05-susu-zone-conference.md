Groups Hub - Talk to SUSU if you have any problems with it working.

Mandatory for membership to go through box-office. Paid membership fees need to be taken through box-office. Groups hub will sync this information and update members when someone buys membership.

Free membership will turn into a button on your society page, with new members having to agree to a privacy statement to join. This will cover emails, storage, trends analysis by the union among other things.

Members will also receive groups-specific emails from the union; they won't be spammed.

SUSU *"take away some of the GDPR liability"*. But, we are still responsible for the information we hold.

All clubs and societies are required to supply bank details and a current balance through www.susu.org ahead of 2018/19 academic year.

They want a full financial outlook of how much money we have, our expenditure, forecasts of our spending, etc. etc.  **Action: Scan of a bank statement, upload bank details to GroupsHub**

Funding - *"We really want to be giving money out at this point"* - need to make sure applications aren't for stuff they can't fund.

You have to upload risk assessments for 2018/19 later this summer. **Action: Create up-to-date risk assessment**. Functionality to do this will appear soon.

Whoever uploads the risk assessment is liable for it being correct. They will be the first port of call if anything happens and the assessment didn't contain a certain hazard.

SUSU accept liability for the security of the data they hold on member information, contact details, etc.

Any further questions, get in touch with them.

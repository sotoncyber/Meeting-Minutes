## Bunfights

184 signups over both the SUSU and FEPS Bunfight. Stall was in a good position right next to the entrance in Jubilee. This was good for visiblity, but bad for people talking to us. A canvas banner or roller banner would be good for meetings also.

Josh will update the intro presentation from last year. We will skip over web101 and go straight to natas challenges.

Dan is working on a new email template using MJML.

## Docker

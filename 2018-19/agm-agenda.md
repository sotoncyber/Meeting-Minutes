# SUCSS AGM 2019 Agenda

Date: 02/05/2018
Time: 18:00-20:00
Location: 58/1065

### Introduction 
- A quick welcome to the meeting. 
- Go through the AGM section of the [constitution](../constitution.pdf) so everyone knows what's going on.
- Ask if anyone wishes the vote to be a secret ballot, in which case paper will be handed out for voting. 
- As per our [constitution](../constitution.pdf), the votes will be counted and recorded by the chair of the meeting.

### Presentations by current committee
- We'll go round the committee who will talk about what's happened over the previous year.

### Election
- Candidates who wish to run should nominate themselves by sending a manifesto via email to sucss@soton.ac.uk before the meeting takes place. This keeps it fair so people can still run, even if they can't make the AGM.
- Positions (See Appendix A) are run through one by one, with nominated candidates presenting their manifestos in a time-limited fashion.
- This speech is followed by questions, which are typically asked in a general fashion and then all candidates for a position are given the opportunity to answer.
- Unfortunately, our [constitution](../constitution.pdf) does not allow for proxy voting, so if you can't make the AGM, sadly you can't vote.

### AOB (Any Other Business)
- If you would like to add any AOB to be discussed at the meeting, please email sucss@soton.ac.uk at least 24hrs in advance.

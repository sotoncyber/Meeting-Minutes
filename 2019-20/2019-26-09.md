## 1. Bunfight reflection

### Positives
- 271 people signed up
- 136 clicked link sent
- Over 50% click-through
- Barcode scanner very good
    - Some IDs did not parse correctly, requiring manual input
    - Predominantly Masters students at SUSU Bunfight
    - Sometimes would only pick up half of barcode, needs length check for next year

### Negatives
- Message should have been worded clearer beforehand
    - Had emails and Facebook messages coming through asking why they 'hadn't been provided with the password'
- Organise displays earlier
    - Need to get a larger display, e.g. pull-up stand or banner across table
    - **ACTION POINT**: AL to look into pull-up stands
    - Look at banner for next year, no practical purpose until Bunfight 2020

## 2. Room booking update
- AL contacted roombook@soton, was told to contact another person responsible for permissions for B67
- AL contacted said individual, received response from roombook later that day saying permission was granted
- Likely we also will have block booking of room for the entire academic year
- **ACTION POINT**: AL to book 46/3001 for 23 October 2019

## 3. Introductory Session
- **ACTION POINT**: Tim to create a sign-up system for Mailman for people wishing to stay in contact
- VB suggests a set-up session, where we do Python programming to get people up to speed
- TS says we need to be 'thoroughly engaging', firstly show SQL problem. Need something akin to Web 101 from 2017-18 and 2018-19
- JD says we should have a thorough explanation of the solution for the Bunfight challenge, 'hand holding'
- VB says we should explain what a web app is, how it works, explain where the vulnerability is with that
- TS suggests keeping the first half of Web 101, and replace the second half with SQL Injection to lead on to explanation for Bunfight challenge. Should keep it as *only* needing a web browser with no additional tools (e.g. Burpsuite)
- AL says we need to explain the Bunfight challenge in the first session as we've told people we will explain it in the first session. 'Keep your promises.'
- VB says direct Bunfight challenge victors to Natas
- **ACTION POINT**: PF to contact Mohit about talk by F-Secure
- **ACTION POINT**: TS to set up public facing Web 101 page for session
- TS says we **must** brief other committee members on the solutions to the challenges to ensure that if people ask for help, we are all able to give a hand
- **ACTION POINT**: VB to integrate parts of Secureatea into Web 101

### Plan
- Introduction to society
- Plan for year
- Hands up for previous experience
    - Who managed to do the Bunfight challenge?
    - Who gave up and cried?
- Point to Web 101
- If completed, Natas
- Every five to ten minutes, ask people how they are progressing with Web 101
- Hour in, explain Bunfight challenge
- At 'end' of the session, go back to Level 3 Zepler, order food, and have a bit of a chat

## 4. Infrastructure Setup Update
- VB set up some small web stuff (secureatea.org)
- Showed off parts of Secureatea to be used for sessions later

## 5. QR codes in Zepler Level 3
- VB says we should point our QR code to the Bunfight challenge, and alter the Bunfight challenge website to have the Facebook group publicised
- TS reiterates that emails need to be sent out at a good time, e.g. Monday morning 11am
- Point QR code to hello-world
- Small QR codes as stickers to 'spam'?
